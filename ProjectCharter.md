# Project Charter - Sea Sharpe

The purpose of this application is to create a space where once a user creates an account he/she is able to login, 
then purchase games and connect with other users.  We want this application to be engaging to users so that it 
retains the current users and brings back any that may have left.  This application will provide CVGS employees 
with the ability to add, edit, and delete games, enter event data, and view and print reports.  Overall, 
we aim to create an appealing, robust, easy-to-use application.
