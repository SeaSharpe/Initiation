## Our current project charter is:

The purpose of this application is to create a space where users can purchase games and connect with each other.
We want this application to be engaging so that it retains current users and brings back any that may have left.
This application will also provide CVGS employees with the ability to add, edit, and delete games, enter event data,
and view and print reports. Overall, we aim to create an appealing, robust, easy-to-use application.
